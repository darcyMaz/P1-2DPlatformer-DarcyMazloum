/*
 * Character Movement Explanation:
 *      I decided to use RigidBody2D for my character because
 *      1) I get to easily manipulate the velocity of the RigidBody (calculate it using SmoothDamp and just multiply that speed by the direction), 
 *      2) I know that it will collide properly with the static colliders since the RigidBody is tracked by the physics engine,
 *      3) I can set the RigidBody to have interpolate=interpolate and collision detection=continuous to avoid common bugs, and 
 *      4) RigidBodys, where the loop is FixedUpdate(), are perfect for 2D platformers where we rely on forces from the physics engine and precise collisions.
 * 
 * Polling vs. Callback Methods:
 *      I decided to use polling for both the movement and the jump because I needed frame by frame precision for both.
 *      I know that you recommend using callbacks for jumps, but it was critical for me to know the exact frame when the jump button was pressed and released.
 *      For example, when the Jump has its velocity cut when the player releases the jump button on the way up. There is one frame where the jump button 
 *          was released AND they are still jumping AND they are still moving upwards. Having all these states be known was critical. By polling I can
 *          easily access the status of the button while also tracking other logic.
 *          
 * Ground Detection Method: RayCast
 *      I decided to use the RayCast for my ground detection for its precision. It allowed the code to have zero frames of ground detection after the 
 *      jump had been performed.
 *      
 * Coyote Time or Buffered Jump: Both
 *      I decided to include both.
